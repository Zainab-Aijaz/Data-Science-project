# Data Science Project
In Task 1 : Titanic Survival Prediction
What I did in this task:
Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset (891 rows, 12 columns)
Performed data cleaning & wrangling:
Handled missing values using mean and mode imputation
Dropped irrelevant columns with excessive null values
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib & Seaborn to understand:
Survival distribution
Gender-wise survival rate
Class-wise survival patterns
Age and fare distributions
Applied categorical encoding to convert non-numerical features into machine-readable form
Separated features and target variables
Split the data into training and testing sets for fair evaluation
Trained a Logistic Regression model
Evaluated the model using accuracy score to measure performance
📌 Key Insights:
Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to males
Passengers from higher classes showed better survival chances
Proper data preprocessing significantly improves model performance


In task 2: Stovk Price Prediction
🔍 What I accomplished in this task:
Analyzed historical stock data containing Open, High, Low, Close, and Trading Volume
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand price trends, distributions, correlations, and variations over time
Handled missing values and ensured proper datetime formatting for time-series understanding
Selected relevant features and prepared the dataset for modeling
Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure fair model evaluation
Trained a Linear Regression model to predict stock closing prices
Evaluated model performance using regression-based metrics
📊 Model Evaluation & Prediction Accuracy:
The model’s prediction accuracy was evaluated using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure average prediction error
Mean Squared Error (MSE) to penalize larger prediction errors
R² Score to assess how well the model explains variations in stock prices
Additionally, an Actual vs Predicted price visualization was used to visually confirm the model’s performance.
